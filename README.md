# Predicting Air Pollution using Spatio-temporal Models

## Introduction
Air pollution is well known to be harmful to human health, especially for children and the elderly. Major sources of air pollution include mechanical processes, the burning of fossil fuels, and other human activity. Consequently, those living in large metropolitan areas risk being subject to higher levels of these harmful particles. However, it's unclear whether the health risks are uniform throughout the city, or if some areas pose higher risks.

The Environmental Protection Agency maintains air monitoring stations around the nation, which help alert citizens when air pollution levels reach dangerous levels. Unfortunately, these stations only measure particle levels at specific locations, and often reports are only given city-wide.

My goal is to be able to accurately predict air pollution in the neighborhoods between air monitoring stations. To do this I will take a machine learning approach, modeling air pollution levels as a function of historical trends and meteorological changes.
